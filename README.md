# Hi, I'm Simon!

I code and make [cool stuff](https://simondmc.com/websites) (mostly web apps) in my free time :)

I also make [Minecraft maps](https://simondmc.com/maps) and sometimes [Spigot plugins](https://simondmc.com/plugins)!

I try to give a proper readme to every released/finished project, so if you find a repo that doesn't have one, chances are it's just a demo, proof of concept or simply unfinished - check back later :))
