# Hi, I'm Simon!

I code and make [cool stuff](https://simondmc.com/websites) (mostly web apps) in my free time :)

I also make [Minecraft maps](https://simondmc.com/maps)!

Yeah my stats aren't that great

[![My GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=SimonDMC&show_icons=true&theme=react)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

I try to give a proper readme to every released/finished project, so if you find a repo that doesn't have one, chances are it's just a demo, proof of concept or simply unfinished - check back later :))
